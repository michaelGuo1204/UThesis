# Experimental Design

| Control | Experiment  | Conclusion                                                   |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A       | B.B and B.C | Our GNN model shows better performance than baseline PRS     |
| A       | B.A         | Tradictional machine learning method cannot classify the genotype data better than PRS |
| B.A.1   | B.A.2       | Feature selection shows little improvements in the AUC       |
| B.B     | B.A         | GNN models outperforms the traditional machine learning model |
| B.B.1   | B.B.2       | Spektral GNN shows better performance that spatial GNN       |
| B.B.2A  | B.B.2B      | Chebyshev net own better AUC than graphal convolutional network |
| B.B.2BA | B.B.2BB     | Equipping the net with ADJ generated by EM or correlation matrix shows similiar AUC, but EM generate ADJ is logically convincing |
| B.C.1   | B.C.1       | Phenotypes of Os are identical and could be applied to classification |
| B.B.2   | B.C.2       | AUC of our model got enhancement by introducing the phenotype |
| B.B.2BB | B.B.2BB | EM generated adj exhibit performance advance in mnist dataset |

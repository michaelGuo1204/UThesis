Prof. Guo advises that osteoarthritis might be a good research.

> [Meta analysis of GWAS in Osteoarthritis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34450027/)

This article conduct a meta-analysis of GWAS. I might not do that meta analysis but just GWAS. So the goal might be **Learning Approach to Osteoarthritis Analysis**

For theoretical basis, I search for definitions of meta-analysis and possible learning approach in GWAS
> [Meta-analysis:]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695132/)
> [Machine learning approach: ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.00350/full)

After discussion with Prof.Guo, there might be three main problems i might cast sight on:

+ Given the GEO data, analysis possible gene loci.
+ Given the Metabolism data, find possible pathway that can be regulated by drugs.
+ Given the patient sample, predict the risk. 

Hence I shall first look through the data and determine which should i pick.

# Prerequisite

## SMR

Summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) is a analytical method for association between GWAS and expression data. This algorithm consists of 

+ $x$ denotes gene expression 

+ $y$ denotes *phenotype*

  >  Could be concentration if mGWAS is introduced

+ $z$ denotes genetic variant 

+ $b_{xy}$ is the effect size $x$ on $y$ ; So calls $b_{zy}$ and $b_{zx}$

+ In an MR, $b_{xy}$ is interpreted as the effect of x on y **without non-genetic confounders**. However, SMR will be able to calculate unbiased $b_{xy}$ due to a genetic factor

### Algorithm

In traditional MR, gene expression's impact upon phenotype is derived from
$$
\hat{b_{xy}}=\hat{b_{zy}}/\hat{b_{zx}}
$$
 where $\hat{b_{zy}}$ and $\hat{b_{zx}}$ are estimates of $y$ and $x$ on $z$. The sampling variance of the estimate is
$$
var(\hat{b_{xy}})=[var(y)(1-R^2_{xy})]/[nvar(x)R^2_{zx}]
$$
 where $n$ is the sample size, $R^2_{xy}$ is the proportion of variance in $y$ explained by $x$ , so called $R^2_{zx}$. Thus we can set up a statistic 
$$
T_{MR}=\hat{b_{xy}}^2/var(\hat{b_{xy}})
$$
to test the significance of $b_{xy}$ by CHI-square examination.  

> Proportion of the variance: Part of variance caused by a reason

However, such estimation requires both gene expression data and genetic data for each individual, which is highly impossible. But if **two-sample MR** is implemented with GWAS data and eQTL data from the same population. We can still have

$$
\hat{b_{xy}}=\hat{b_{zy}}/\hat{\beta_{zx}}
$$
where

+ $\hat{b_{zy}}$ is the estimate of a SNP effect from a GWAS for a trait
+ $\hat{\beta_{zx}}$ is the estimate of a SNP effect on the expression by eQTL study. 

The variance can be calculated as 
$$
var(\hat{b_{xy}})=\frac{b^2_{zy}}{\beta^2_{zx}} [\frac{var(\hat\beta_{zx})}{\beta^2_{zx}}+\frac{var(\hat b_{zy})}{b^2_{zy}}-\frac{2cov(\hat\beta_{zx},\hat b_{zy})}{\beta_{zx} b_{zy}}]
$$

> $cov(\hat\beta_{zx},\hat b_{zy})$ is **0** if $\beta_{zx}$  and  $ b_{zy}$ are from independent samples

Thus we have a statistic for a Chi-square examination
$$
T_{SMR}=\hat b^2_{xy}/var(\hat b_{xy})=\frac{z^2_{zy}z^2_{zx}}{z^2_{zy}+z^2_{zx}}
$$
 where $z$ are statistics from GWAS and eQTL

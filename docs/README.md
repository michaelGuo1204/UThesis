Prof. Guo advises that osteoarthritis might be a good research.

> [Meta analysis of GWAS in Osteoarthritis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34450027/)

This article conduct a meta-analysis of GWAS. I might not do that meta analysis but just GWAS. So the goal might be **Learning Approach to Osteoarthritis Analysis**

For theoretical basis, I search for definitions of meta-analysis and possible learning approach in GWAS
> [Meta-analysis:]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695132/)
> [Machine learning approach: ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.00350/full)

After discussion with Prof.Guo, there might be three main problems i might cast sight on:

+ Given the GEO data, analysis possible gene loci.
+ Given the Metabolism data, find possible pathway that can be regulated by drugs.
+ Given the patient sample, predict the risk. 

Hence I shall first look through the data and determine which should i pick.

# Data collection

## Workplace

Using UKB to apply final multimodal model for risk evaluation

Similar research has been performed as [GWAS for osteo](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0079-y)

# ~~Motivation~~

# Shift

However, after discussion with Prof. Guo. My intention of setting that three source network was denied, I hence need to
come up with a new strategy.

After screening the following articles and integrating Guo's advice. A new setup is to be made:

# GNN Development

## Naive GNN

Start from TIID data i retreived last year, i start the development of a simple GNN based on the research
from [Design Space for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08843). Main guidlines are

$$ x_i' = \mathrm{Agg} \left( \left\{ \mathrm{Act} \left( \mathrm{Dropout} \left( \mathrm{BN} \left( x_j W + b \right)
\right) \right), j \in \mathcal{N}(i) \right\} \right)
$$

To test the network, I apply 3 conGNN layers to deal with the graph and a pool layer to readout or just eliminate the
unrelated nodes. Detailed structures is

+ GNN Layer with 128 channels 0.1 dropout
+ GNN Layer with 64 channels 0.1 dropout
+ GNN Layer with 32 channels 0.1 dropout
+ Pooling layer by summing
+ Dense Layer to make prediction

Current trained model showed well convergence of train loss, but limited by the data quality, accuracy is still
reletively low. Thus I might take the data from UKB's osteoarthritis genotype to make further progress.



<img src="./media/GNN/Train_loss.svg" alt="Loss" style="zoom:10%;" />

## Awkward

However, when i first selected the 100 SNP loci derived from Nature article, forming a dataset with 17000 samples and
100 features, i failed to construct a reasonable classification model. I tried it on kNN, randomForest and Xgboost, the
AUC was unacceptable (0.52).

According to the supplementary data of that article, these snps does not exhibit well classification potential (AUC0.5
by PRS). So i change another snp sources based on research upon UKB data. (UKB data branch in GITHUB)

Shit always happens, new data set (SNP=77) has little increase on AUC(0.52-0.54). So I still need to refer to article
for solutions. One research reveals that increasing the input features will improve the performance. So i make another
dataset with p<1e-5 and MAF >0.01 (SNP=8800).

BUT BUT BUT, the result is still schlecht (AUC0.6 by XGboost). HOW could it happen?! Article tells me that the coding
pattern might matter. So i change from ATCG one-hot encoding to **Effect Allele** numbers observed in SNP loci. AUC
improved a little. Then i realize that i cannot just provide that too much features to its samples(8000:6000). So i
conduct a feature selection procedure based on both Chi-square and linear SVC fs methods. Finally, AUC of simple model (
Decision Tree) goes better.

## Basic model

| model_type     | metric_type   |   metric_value |
|:---------------|:--------------|---------------:|
| Baseline       | auc           |       0.5      |
| Decision Tree  | auc           |       0.644074 |
| Xgboost        | auc           |       0.714733 |
| Neural Network | auc           |       0.649612 |
| Random Forest  | auc           |       0.681943 |
| **PRS** | auc           |  0.63 |

The baseline of the total research is the **PRS** result, getting AUC of 0.63

## GNN Model

For the convenience of the project i select spectral as the GNN package, building the model as

+ Input
+ 64 - Channels GNN
+ 64 - Channels GNN
+ Readout Layer
+ Dense
+ Dense

The training result goes as

<img src="./media/GNN/General GNN Train LOSS.svg" alt="trainLOSS" style="zoom:25%;" />

The optimal model goes as follows

# GNN explainer

According to the [GNN explainer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03894), i can retrieve the essential data contributing to
the prediction task. Taking different threshold on the sub graph, i can find some thing interesting.

For instance, for Case 4496347 in UKB, i got subgraph as
![springSub35](./media/GNNEx/springSub0.35.png)

The SNP has the feature as

| RSID        | FREQ   | Effect  | P         |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| rs10912775  | 0.2448 | -0.0325 | 4.041E-07 |
| rs332797    | 0.2496 | -0.0313 | 8.768E-07 |
| rs12065527  | 0.2475 | -0.0328 | 5.929E-07 |
| rs4652425   | 0.2452 | -0.0327 | 3.37E-07  |
| rs112519723 | 0.2474 | -0.031  | 1.217E-06 |
| rs2568096   | 0.2498 | -0.0309 | 1.228E-06 |
| rs10912776  | 0.2448 | -0.0325 | 4.051E-07 |
| rs12084948  | 0.2464 | -0.0327 | 3.115E-07 |

Relaxing the threshold, we can get

There will be more SNPs found contributing to the prediction. Nevertheless, the detailed meaning of this graph remains
unknown and awaits later interception.
